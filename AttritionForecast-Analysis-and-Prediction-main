AttritionForecast: Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on understanding and predicting employee attrition using HR data. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Business Intelligence dashboards, and Machine Learning models to help HR teams identify which employees are at risk of leaving and the key factors contributing to turnover.

Project Overview:

Employee attrition causes serious problems for organizations including loss of talent, higher hiring costs, reduced productivity, and workload pressure on remaining employees. This project answers the following questions:

Why are employees leaving?
Which employees are most likely to leave?
What factors are influencing attrition?
How can HR take proactive steps to reduce attrition?

This is an end-to-end HR analytics project covering EDA, BI visualization, and predictive modeling.

EDA Summary (Text Format):

EDA was performed to understand employee behavior, relationships between variables, and attrition patterns. Key steps:

Basic data inspection

Handling missing values

Visualizing attrition distribution

Comparing attrition across departments

Salary vs attrition comparison

Overtime impact on attrition

Work-life balance vs attrition

Job satisfaction distribution

Correlation heatmap to identify strong relationships

Key Findings:

Employees doing overtime showed higher attrition.

Lower monthly income groups had higher attrition.

Job roles like Sales and IT had higher turnover.

Longer commute distance increased attrition probability.

Low job satisfaction strongly correlated with leaving.

BI Dashboard Content (Text Explanation):

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Attrition by department

Attrition by job role

Attrition by salary band

Attrition by education

Attrition by gender

Attrition by distance from home

Attrition by job satisfaction

Filters for department, salary, overtime

KPI cards: Total employees, total attrition, attrition %

This dashboard helps HR visualize the risk areas instantly.

Machine Learning Model Explanation:
